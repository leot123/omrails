CREATING PAGES

 

How to add pages
			First step is to create a controller for our pages 
			rails aps are broken into three parts 
			1. controllers
						pages you can show users. 
						to have ownership over pages the controller deals with the actions

CODE: $ rails generate controller Pages home             


# Create a Pages controller with a home action
create  app/controllers/pages_controller.rb
       route  get "pages/home"
      invoke  erb
      create    app/views/pages
      create    app/views/pages/home.html.erb
      invoke  test_unit
      create    test/functional/pages_controller_test.rb
      invoke  helper
      create    app/helpers/pages_helper.rb
      invoke    test_unit
      create      test/unit/helpers/pages_helper_test.rb
      invoke  assets
      invoke    coffee
      create      app/assets/javascripts/pages.js.coffee
      invoke    scss
      create      app/assets/stylesheets/pages.css.scss



$ rm public/index.html                                        # public/index.html will automatically override any root route set

				2. views- this is what you view
when you create a page in sublime text and save it under pages under views, the program knows the layout allows you to change all pages so that every page has a "home" "about" link so you don't have to individually add every single one 


Layout
				everything in layout is actually on every page. however, the yield part is where everything under the home or about tabs goes in. where all the coding goes in


				3. models
				$ rails generate controller Pages home  
				this will allow you to open http://localhost:3000/pages/home because this command we ran creates a route for this
Find me in app/views/pages/home.html.erb
you might need to restart subl if you already have it open

this command also created a controller  under app/controller/pages controller
it created a controller
its defined the controller at the top and bottom of the file
and withint it defines the home action and where the action ends 
route file under config/routes.rb and created 
get "pages/home"
there is a home action adn a home view
the route file is a file in the application that when people issue a command like try to go to a specific url, it will figure out which action under which controller it should be sending them to. 
in the get "pages/home" case the pages is the controller and home is the action and the home.html.erb is the view it should be loading
we want to set "pages/home" as the root of the application which meansthat when someone goes to the basic url that they will end up at the home page. 
so we delete get "pages/home" abecause what we really want is to set the root
under the hints it states
  # You can have the root of your site routed with "root"
  # just remember to delete public/index.html.
		we need to delete public/index.html which is the standard default page every project comes with.  as long as this exists, it will override any route
  # root :to => 'welcome#index'
		after removing the public index then we have to change the welcome controller casue we dont have on. because right now it is trying to get to the welcome controller but it cant and instead of index our pages controller has a home action to add a new page we could have passed another command page but we can also do it costum


Boostrap- one bootstrap feature is that is that when the page shrinks, the tab appears to move the stuff in the navbar into a list.
  - the reason why the expanding and contracting thing works, is because we added the javascript =require bootstrap  under javascript/application.js
